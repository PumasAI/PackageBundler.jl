    bundle(config = "PackageBundler.toml"; clean = false)

Bundle a set of packages into a single readonly registry. The packages are
stripped of their source code and only the serialized version of the code is
included in the bundle. The bundled files are signed with a private key and the
public key is included in the bundle. The bundle can be verified with the public
key.

```toml
name = "PackageBundle"                        # default: "PackageBundle"
uuid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # required
environments = ["env1", "env2"]               # required
outputs = "PackageBundle"                     # default: same as `name`
key = "key"                                   # default: "key"
clean = false                                 # default: false
multiplexers = ["asdf", "juliaup"]            # default: []
handlers = []                                 # default: []

[packages]
"<uuid>" = "<name>"

[registries]
"<uuid>" = "<name>"
```

The `environments` field is a list of paths to Julia environments that should be
included in the bundle as global environments. A `Project.toml` and a matching
`Manifest.toml` file must exist in each environment. `LocalPreferences.toml`
could also, if required by the environment, be included in the environment
directory. When bundled these environments will have the modifications applied
to them such that the required extra packages are available and the versions of
all packages within the environment are locked to the original version and
cannot be adjusted:

  - `Serialization` is installed into the direct dependencies of the environment.
    This is required for stripped code to be able to be loaded.
  - All packages are added to the `compat` and `extras` sections to ensure their
    versions remain fixed should an end-user add anything to the environment after
    installation.

The `packages` field provides the UUIDs and names of all packages that should be
stripped of source code and included in the bundle. They must be valid Julia
packages available in the environments listed in `environments`.

The `registries` field provides the UUIDs and names of all registries that
should be stripped of source code and included in the bundle. `packages` and
`registries` get merged together into a single list of packages to strip. The
`registries` field is useful for including entire registries in the bundle to
avoid the chance of missing any packages that are not listed in `packages`
should your dependencies change.

The `outputs` field is the target for the bundle. It can be a directory, a
tarball, or an `Artifacts.toml` file. Or it can be an array of multiple targets.
For `Artifacts.toml` files the `artifacts_url` field must be specified, which
points at the URL where the tarball can be downloaded from.

The `key` field is the name of the private and public key files. The private key
is used to sign the bundled packages and the public key is included in the
bundle. The public key is used to verify the bundle. The private key is expected
to be a PEM encoded RSA private key. The public key is expected to be a PEM
encoded RSA public key. A key size of 4096 bits is recommended. Ensure that you
do not lose the private key, it cannot be recovered.

The `clean` field is a boolean flag that determines whether the output directory
should be cleaned before generating the bundle. If `clean` is `true` and the
output directory exists it will be deleted before generating the bundle. `clean`
has no effect if the output is a tarball or an `Artifacts.toml` file.

The `multiplexers` field sets the allowed multiplexer programs to use to select
specific versions of Julia for each environment based on it's `julia_version`.
`"juliaup"`, `"asdf"`, and `"mise"` are supported. This is an ordered list of
options, each of which are tried in turn until one is found that can be used to
select the correct Julia version. If no multiplexer is found then the current
`julia` is used.

The `handlers` field is a list of paths to handler scripts that are used to
inject or transform code in the bundled packages. The handler scripts must be
valid Julia files that return a `Function` accepting the required arguments as
listed below. The valid names for handlers are:

  - `code_loader.jl`: A function that generates the `String` of code used to
    load the serialized code. Takes `jls`, `xorshift`, and `entry_point` as
    arguments.
  - `code_transformer.jl`: A function that transforms the parsed code before it
    is serialized. Takes `filename` and `expr` as arguments.
  - `code_injector.jl`: A function that injects extra code into the bundled
    packages. Takes `filename` as an argument.
